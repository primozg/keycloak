Keycloak openldap module ppolicy Creates home, uid,guid .... attributes to work with linux users in openldap. alike MSAD for MS.

    Configure opepldap classic module in user federation
    Add mapper ldap-ppolicy-attribute-mapper, configure as you like, nobrainer

Works for me, open for upgrades.
